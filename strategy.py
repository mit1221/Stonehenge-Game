    Return a move for game by picking a move which results in a state with
    the lowest rough_outcome() for the opponent.

    NOTE: game.rough_outcome() should do the following:
        - For a state that's over, it returns the score for the current
          player of that state.
        - For a state that's not over:
            - If there is a move that results in the current player winning,
              return 1.
            - If all moves result in states where the other player can
              immediately win, return -1.
            - Otherwise; return a number between -1 and 1 corresponding to how
              'likely' the current player will win from the current state.

        In essence: rough_outcome() will only look 1 or 2 states ahead to
        'guess' the outcome of the game, but no further. It's better than
        random, but worse than minimax.
