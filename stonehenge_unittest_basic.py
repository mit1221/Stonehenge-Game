A subset of the unittests used for testing Stonehenge.

These unittests only test for basic functionality and whether we can properly
test your code (i.e. you take in the right parameters and your __str__ returns
something that the unittests can understand). They do *not* test your code
extensively.

The sample Stonehenge boards below are a version of the Stonehenge boards that
the unittests can properly read. i.e. The ley-lines and cells are in the right
spots and order; yours **do not** have to be formatted in exactly the same
